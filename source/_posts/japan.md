# Traveling
## Prefer japan
I want to say why I prefer it after traveling in Japan.

## Reason one
Taiwan which is the country I live in, is often said to be the best place to travel or to live in. But in my opinion, I think it is not. Many people say **"Oh Taiwanese are friendly and the landscape is beautiful!!"** I can't say they are wrong but I think maybe it is my problem because I have lived here for about two decades, **I knowing the custom here and many things are daily for me, everything is boring to me**.

## Reason two
2024/1/23 I traveled to Japan, I saw many new scapes and people.
![temple_1](/img/japan/temple_1.JPG)Everything is fresh to me, I'm like a baby full of curiosity and vitality. I took many pictures, eat many food, watch many beautiful things. I like its JR, it is clean, quiet, fast and more friendly but a fly in the ointment was too complicated, there were about 30 stops in a train station, so it was difficult to find the stop I want to go. I was impressed by the first sky I saw when I got off the plane, is **the bluest and cleanest sky I ever seen**.

## Reason three
ㅤㅤ To be honest, noise from cars and motorcycles are more quiet. I didn't hear any noise from motorcycles like exploding boom it was a point why I prefer Japan. Another point is **friendly and safety to pedestrians**, you don't need to be careful when you are crossing the road, they don't like Taiwanese, they will stop and wait you to cross the road, is amazing to me although Taiwan have already make law to limit the driver need stop to wait the pedestrian cross the road, many drivers don't follow the law so we still need to stop and look around to ensure we won't be hit by the driver, the law is a joke, I don't know why the government writes a law but don't fully executed.

## The last reason
ㅤㅤ The other point is the **clean city**. In Taiwan, you will see people spit something disgusting in their mouth to the ground arbitrary I can't stand that, can you imagine when you walk around the streets then you should be care if you don't want to step on anything disgusting? However, you will be scared by the red things on the ground, it isn't the blood, is betel nut, something can cheer people. In Japan, I didn't see any dirty things on the ground or anywhere, even the lane.
